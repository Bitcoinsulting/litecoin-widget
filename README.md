It's called "Litecoin Widget", but it's been stretching that definition lately.

The widget will show you prices for BTC, LTC, NMC, PPC, TRC, and FTC. Prices come mostly from vircurex and btc-e, but also mtgox for BTC.

Prices are quoted in terms of BTC (for alt coins), and the old-world currency of your choice (for all coins).

Many things are estimated, since not all of these pairs trade and I am too lazy to implement direct API calls for umpteen different currencies. Anytime a price was estimated, it is marked with an asterisk. Please be aware, these numbers could be based on cached information even if you refresh. Old-world currency rates are cached for up to 1 hour. The BTC/USD exchange rate is cached for up to five minutes. Also, accuracy is limited as the BTC rate differs across exchanges, and the widget will choose whichever cached BTC rate it can find (that's at least 5 minutes fresh) in order to reduce extra network traffic.

It's on the app store as "Litecoin Widget" by The Mad Geniuses.
